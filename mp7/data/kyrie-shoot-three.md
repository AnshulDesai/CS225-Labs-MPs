Confident in your three shooting ability, you pull a shot outside the line without much thinking.  The ball hits the right side of the rim...then bounces out.  "The played out a lot differently in my mind," you tell yourself.  However, Ingram is able to rebound the ball and tip slam for an additional two points added to the score.  Ingram looks to you and says, "I was open too, you know."  You look at the clock and see that there are 49 seconds left and the score is 109-108 Celtics.  Kyrie runs the ball to the top of the key and you ensure that he never leaves your sight.  Kyrie is a player of remarkable skill and agility.  He might either pop a three or pull off a dribble move to get past you.
