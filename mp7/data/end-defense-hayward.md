You decide to leave Kyrie and run over to cover Gordon Hayward.  However by doing so, you left Kyrie exposed at the top of the key.  LeBron runs over to Kyrie who attemps to pull a three and...the shot is made.  The score is now 112-108 Celics with 24 seconds left on the clock.  McGee inbounds the ball to you as you find a clear opening.  You look to the rim, and then at the clock.  3 seconds.  You won't win, but you all you can do is hope.  The ball leaves contact from your middle finger as you see the ball perfectly arc into the basket for three points right as the buzzer rings.  GAME, you lose with a score of 112-111.
