You pass the ball to Kyle Kuzma, hoping he'd pull it from the alley and tie up the score.  Kuzma rushes to the right corner of the wing and notices and prepares to shoot.  However, Aron Baynes jumps for the block and Kuzma ends up pump faking the shot and passing to you who is standing outside of the key.  Out of the corner of your eye you notice Kyrie Irving only a few feet away rushing to block.
