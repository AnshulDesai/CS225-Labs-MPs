You maintain a loose defensive position, expecting Kyrie to create some space in order to shoot a three.  Kyrie instead does quite the opposite, stepping back and then spinning right past you.  With an open lane, Kyrie dunks his shot bring the score up to 111-108 Celtics.  With 17 seconds left on the clock, you realize that there is still time to pull off a win.  You just don't know how.  The ball is inbounded to Ingram who passes the ball to you.
