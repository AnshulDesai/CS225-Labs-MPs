You pass the ball to LeBron James, hoping he'd find an open lane or pass.  However, it seems that the Celtics are well aware of LeBron's intentions.  Immediately you find an open spot to the left of the key as Kyrie Irving is left double teaming LeBron with Jayson Tatum.  You call for the ball and LeBron passes it to you but out of the corner of your eye you notice Kyrie only a few feet away rushing to block.
