It's overtime of Game 7 of the 2020 NBA Finals.  1 minute left on the clock.  The Celtics are up 109-106.  It seemed like it was only a few days ago you were the Lakers first round pick.  As short lived as the season may have felt, it has all been left to this moment.  On the court: You, Brandon Ingram, LeBron James, Kyle Kuzma, and JaVale McGee vs, Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Aron Baynes, and Al Horford.  You inbound the ball but you're unsure who to throw it to.

# inbound-lebron
You pass the ball to LeBron James, hoping he'd find an open lane or pass.

# inbound-kuzma
You pass the ball to Kyle Kuzma, hoping he'd pull it from the alley and tie up the score.
